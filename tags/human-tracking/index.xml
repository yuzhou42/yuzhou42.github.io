 Human detection and tracking Trajectory generation System integration  This work has resulted in papers published in the IEEE ICCA and IECON 2018.
   Video 1. Dog-Drone demo
At this stage, to prove the concept, we are using the off-the-shelf flight platform with a visual odometry integration.</description>
