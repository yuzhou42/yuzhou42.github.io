      <description>Along with 4 other teammates from the State Key Laboratory of Robotics, I participated in the 3rd International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Grand Prix, held at the end of October 2015. The task of this competition was to accomplish the autonomous cargo transportation task with a UAV. There were two moving platforms: both had four markers and one had 4 buckets placed on it. The UAV had to transport buckets between the two moving platforms, as shown on Figure 1.</description>
